I’m a Fullstack JavaScript Engineer with **9 years** of experience building and scaling web applications. I specialize in both modern **frontend** frameworks like **React** and **Angular** and backend technologies such as **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

Over the years, I’ve worked on automating **CI/CD pipelines**, designing **microservices**, and improving application **performance**. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, tackling legacy code challenges, and creating user-focused solutions that deliver real business impact.

I’m passionate about clean, **maintainable code**, following best practices like **TDD** and scalable **design patterns**, and building software that truly meets user needs while staying technically robust.
