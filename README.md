I am an energetic person, an effective communicator, a quick learner, and a problem solver. I worked on various projects related to the software domain which provided me a great deal of technical exposure along with the importance of working in a team and the value of client satisfaction. 

I have worked on developing various enterprise-level web applications for helping companies solve problems for sectors like retail, legaltech, education, healtech, marketing, e-commerce.
